       <p>Hello, my name is Saroj and I am 22 years old. I am originally from Jhapa, a beautiful district in the eastern region of Nepal. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (BIT) in Kathmandu. I have been studying in the capital city since 2018 and have been thoroughly enjoying my experience here.
        <br><br>
        I have always been interested in technology and its endless possibilities, which led me to choose BIT as my academic field. I am passionate about learning new programming languages and exploring the latest trends in the tech industry. During my studies, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects and gain practical experience in software development, web development, and database management.

     <p>The richness and diversity of the Hindu pantheon are truly amazing, and it's no wonder that this ancient religion has captured the imaginations of so many people throughout history. Whether one believes in these deities as literal entities or simply as powerful symbols and archetypes, there's no denying the beauty and complexity of the myths and traditions associated with them.</p>

    <h2 class="welcome">My story</h2>
    <p>I am the protagonist of this story. I was born on June 25, 2000, and my life has been a journey full of ups and downs.

        Growing up, I faced many challenges, but I never let them get the best of me. I studied at a convent English school until the 10th grade, and then I moved on to study at Balmiki for my higher secondary education.
        
        Despite the difficulties I faced, I am a joyful person who loves to live in the moment and enjoy life's simple pleasures. I believe that everyone deserves happiness and kindness, regardless of their background or circumstances.
        
        However, I have also experienced hurt and pain in my life. But I have learned that those experiences do not define me. Instead, I use them to fuel my desire for peace in the world.
        
        I have a deep desire to make a positive impact, no matter how small. I believe that we can achieve peace in the world if we all work together towards that goal. Even the smallest act of kindness can make a huge difference in someone's life.
